The Prophet (ﷺ) replied that he couldn't read. The angel squeezed him three times, then said 'Read in the name of your Lord, who has created all things.' The Prophet (ﷺ) returned home, feeling scared. He told his wife Khadija what had happened. She reassured him that Allah would never disappoint him. Later, they visited a cousin named Waraqa, who was an old Christian man and could read Hebrew. Waraqa confirmed that the angel Gabriel was real and that anyone with a message like the Prophet's would be rejected by their people."

Heraclius asked his translator to ask Abu Sufyan about the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). Abu Sufyan said he was related to the Prophet and that he belonged to a good family. Heraclius asked if anyone else claimed to be a prophet before him, and Abu Sufyan said no. He also asked if any of the Prophet's ancestors were kings, and Abu Sufyan said no. Heraclius then asked about the Prophet's followers: were they rich or poor? Abu Sufyan said they were poor. Heraclius asked if his followers increased or decreased in number, and Abu Sufyan said they increased. He also asked if anyone who became Muslim would leave Islam, but Abu Sufyan said no. Heraclius then asked what the Prophet taught them to do, and Abu Sufyan said he taught them to worship Allah alone and not associate anything with Him. He also taught them to pray, speak the truth, be chaste, and keep good relations with their kin. Heraclius was impressed by Abu Sufyan's answers and thought that the Prophet would soon conquer his empire. He even wanted to meet the Prophet himself and wash his feet! Heraclius then asked for a letter from the Prophet, which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra and forwarded to him. The letter invited Heraclius to Islam and warned him that if he rejected it, he would be committing a sin. Heraclius read the letter and there was a big commotion in his court. He realized that the Prophet's message was spreading quickly and that even the King of Byzantine was afraid of him."

The Prophet (ﷺ) replied that nobody knows except Allah. He told Gabriel to leave, but he couldn't be seen again. The Prophet (ﷺ) said Gabriel was teaching people about their religion."

Pray on time every day. 3. Give to those in need during Ramadan. 4. Share one fifth of any war spoils with the poor.

They followed the fish for a night and a day until it stopped swimming. There, they met a man covered in a cloak. Moses greeted him and introduced himself. The wise man, Al-Khadir, asked how people greet each other in Moses' land. He then told Moses that he couldn't stay with him because Moses wouldn't be patient enough to learn from him. They got on a boat with the crew, who recognized Al-Khadir and let them travel for free. A sparrow dipped its beak into the sea, showing how little knowledge is lost when two people share it. Al-Khadir then removed a plank from the boat, which sank. Moses was angry that Al-Khadir had damaged the boat. They continued their journey until they found a boy playing with other children. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head and killed him. Moses was shocked and asked why he had killed an innocent child. They then came to a town where people refused to give them food, but Al-Khadir fixed a wall that was about to collapse."

He said that's because Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) never touched those corners except the ones facing south. He also saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) wearing shoes without hair and performing ablution while wearing them, so he liked to wear similar shoes. And he dyed his hair with Hinna just like Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did. Finally, Abdullah didn't see Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) assume Ihram until they set out for Hajj on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijja."

The Prophet (ﷺ) said it was okay and they should leave. They traveled some more and then stopped again. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked for water to perform ablution. He led the people in prayer after that. A man who hadn't prayed with them explained he was Junub (ritually impure) because there was no water. The Prophet (ﷺ) told him to use earth for Tayammum instead. People complained about thirst, so the Prophet sent Ali and another person to find water. They met a woman sitting on her camel with two bags of water. She agreed to go with them to meet the Prophet. When they arrived, the Prophet helped her dismount and used her water to give everyone a drink. He also gave some water to the man who was Junub. After that, he gave her food and she went back home. Her relatives asked her what had delayed her, and she told them about meeting the Prophet. She said it seemed like he might be either a great magician or Allah's true Apostle.

He laughed when he looked at his right side and cried when he looked at his left. Gabriel explained that those on Adam's right were in Paradise and those on his left were in Hell. We went up to the second heaven, then met Idris, Moses, Jesus, and Abraham. Each of them welcomed me as a pious brother or son. Then we reached a place where we heard the sound of pens writing. Allah told me that He had ordered my followers to pray 50 times a day. I went back to Allah and asked for a reduction, which was reduced to 25 prayers. But Moses said this would still be too much for my followers. So I went back to Allah again and asked for another reduction, which was reduced to 12.5 prayers. Again, Moses said this would be too hard for my followers. So I went back to Allah one more time, and He said that the 5 daily prayers are equal in reward to 50 prayers. Gabriel took me up to a tree called Sidrat-il-Muntaha, which was surrounded by beautiful colors. Then we entered Paradise, where I saw small houses made of pearls and earth made of musk."

Those who traveled east found the Prophet praying with his companions near a place called Nakhla. They heard the Quran and knew it was the barrier between them and heaven's news. The devils' people believed in the Quran and stopped worshiping idols."

Some will follow the sun, some the moon, and others other deities. Only Muslims will remain with their hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, 'I am Your Lord.' They will agree. Then Allah will call them again and a bridge called As-Sirat will be laid across Hell. I (Muhammad (ﷺ)) will cross it first with my followers. Nobody except prophets can speak then, saying, 'O Allah! Save us.' There will be hooks in Hell that look like thorns of Sa'dan. They will catch people according to their deeds. Some will fall and stay in Hell forever, others will get punished or taken out when Allah decides to show mercy. Those who worshipped only Him will be recognized by the marks of their prostrations and taken out. The Water of Life will make them grow like seeds on a riverbank. When all judgments are finished, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise. He will ask Allah to turn his face from the fire because it has dried him. Allah will ask if he wants anything else. He will say no. Then Allah will turn his face from the Fire and let him see Paradise's charm. He will stay quiet for a while, then ask to go to the gate of Paradise. Allah will remind him of his promises not to ask for more than what was given. The man will promise again not to ask for anything else. Allah will let him enter Paradise, where he can request as much as he likes until all his desires are fulfilled."

Anyone who wants to come with me should hurry.' When they arrived in Medina, the Prophet saw a mountain and said it was a good place.

The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and his friends arrived in Mecca on the 4th day of Dhul-Hijja. He told them to change their plans from doing Hajj to just visiting the Kaaba for Umra instead. They were confused, so they asked him what they could do. The Prophet (ﷺ) said that since they had already started Ihram (special clothes), they should finish it like normal people and not follow any special rules."

The man told him where the Prophet was, so my father followed the tracks and caught up with him. My father said, 'The Prophet 's (ﷺ) friends send their greetings and ask for blessings. They're worried about being left behind.' He also offered them some meat he had hunted from an onager. The Prophet (ﷺ) allowed his friends to eat it even though they were in a special state."

At midnight, I met a man from Bani Ghifar who told me where the Prophet was. He said he would rest at As-Suqya and wait for us. So I caught up with the Prophet and asked him to wait for my friends. They were worried that the enemy might get in between them and us. The Prophet (ﷺ) agreed to wait. Then I offered some of the donkey's meat, but they all had to eat it even though they were already in a state of Ihram."

He offered to protect Abu Bakr, so Quraish agreed. They told Abu Bakr to pray at home and not cause trouble. But Abu Bakr built a mosque in his house and prayed there. Women and children would gather around him, and he couldn't help crying while reading the Quran. The pagan chiefs were worried that Abu Bakr's example might influence their families. They asked Ibn Ad-Daghna to tell Abu Bakr to stop or return the protection. Ibn Ad-Daghna went to Abu Bakr and said either follow the conditions or revoke his protection. Abu Bakr chose Allah's protection over Ibn Ad-Daghna's. When this happened, the Prophet was still in Mecca and told his companions that their emigration place had been shown to him. Some of them left for Medina, while others returned from Ethiopia. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Abu Bakr to wait because he expected permission to leave.

She traveled with the Prophet in a howdah, but when she got off to answer nature's call, her necklace was missing. The people carrying her thought she was still inside and left without waiting for her. Aisha found her necklace later and went back to the camp, but everyone had already left. She waited until morning, then Safwan bin Mu'attal saw her sleeping and woke her up. He took her to the army's resting place, where they were accused of wrongdoing by some people led by Abdullah bin Ubai. Aisha was ill for a month while the accusations spread. When she recovered, she went out with Um Mistah to answer nature's call and heard the rumors about herself. She went back home and asked her parents what was happening. They told her that women often get accused of wrongdoing when they are loved by their husbands. Aisha was sad and didn't sleep for two nights and a day. The Prophet (ﷺ) consulted his companions, Ali and Usama, but they said he should keep her as his wife because she had a good reputation. Barirah, the slave girl, testified that Aisha was innocent except for being young and sometimes sleeping. The Prophet (ﷺ) went to the pulpit and asked people to support him in punishing Abdullah bin Ubai. Sa'd bin Mu'adh offered to kill him if he was from the Aus tribe or follow the Prophet's order if he was from the Khazraj tribe. But Sa'd bin 'Ubada defended his tribe, saying they couldn't kill him. The two tribes were about to fight when the Prophet intervened and calmed them down. Aisha was still sad and crying when the Prophet came to her and said that if she was innocent, Allah would soon declare it. If she had sinned, she should repent and ask for forgiveness. Aisha's mother asked the Prophet to talk on her behalf, but he said he wouldn't believe her if she denied the accusations or believed her if she confessed falsely. Aisha then compared herself to Joseph's father, who said patience was best in such situations. She turned away from her bed, hoping Allah would prove her innocence. Suddenly, the Prophet got a revelation that declared Aisha's innocence. He was sweating and smiling when he told Aisha the news. Abu Bakr stopped helping Mistah bin Uthatha because of his role in spreading the accusations, but later Allah revealed a verse forgiving those who forgive others. The Prophet (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about Aisha, and she said she knew nothing except goodness about her."

The pagans said this would be strange if he were truly a prophet. They wouldn't fight him then. Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) asked Ali to erase it, but Ali refused. So, Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) erased it himself and made peace with them. As part of the deal, he and his companions could enter Mecca with their swords in cases for three days."

A document was written with their agreement. But they didn't want it to say 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)' because they didn't believe he was a prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) agreed to change it and wrote: 'This is what Muhammad (ﷺ) bin Abdullah has agreed upon.' He promised not to bring arms into Mecca, and no one from Mecca could go with him unless they wanted to stay in Mecca themselves. When the three days were over, the people of Mecca asked the Prophet to leave. The Prophet 's (ﷺ) companions argued about who should take care of a young girl whose father was Hamza, the Prophet's uncle. The Prophet (ﷺ) said she should be given to her aunt, because an aunt is like a mother. He also praised his companions: Ali was like a brother to him, Ja'far looked like him and had good character, and Zaid was their brother in faith."

Khalid bin Al-Walid, who was leading the cavalry of Quraish, tried to stop the Muslim army. The Prophet 's (ﷺ) camel stopped at Thaniya, and he said it had been stopped by Allah. He then rebuked his camel, and it got up. The Prophet (ﷺ) changed his route and went to a place called Al-Hudaibiya. There was a well with some water, but when the people drank from it, they complained of thirst. The Prophet (ﷺ) took an arrow out of his quiver and put it in the well. Water started flowing, and everyone quenched their thirst. Budail bin Warqa came to the Prophet and told him that Ka'b and 'Amir were planning to attack them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said he was not there to fight but to perform Umra. He offered a truce with Quraish, which they accepted. They agreed that if Muhammad (ﷺ) won, Quraish would have the option to convert to Islam. Suhail bin 'Amr and Mikraz bin Hafs came to negotiate with the Prophet. They wrote a peace treaty, but it was not easy. The Prophet (ﷺ) had to agree to return Abu Jandal, who was one of his companions, to Quraish. When the treaty was written, the Prophet ordered his companions to slaughter their sacrifices and shave their heads. But they did not move until he did it first. Some believing women came and reminded them of Allah's orders. The Prophet (ﷺ) then returned to Medina and Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish, came to him. He was handed over to the two men who had come with him, but he escaped and killed one of them. He then joined Abu Jandal and together they formed a strong group that attacked Quraish caravans heading towards Sham."

The Prophet (ﷺ) told his companions to take the right path, and they reached Thaniya mountain. The Prophet 's (ﷺ) she-camel sat down, but it got up when he rebuked it. He said that the camel had not become stubborn, but was stopped by Allah. If Quraish asked for something that respected Allah's laws, he would grant it to them. The people used up all the water from a pit and complained to the Prophet. He took an arrow out of his quiver and ordered them to put it in the pit. Water started flowing from the pit, and everyone quenched their thirst. Budail bin Warqa came with some people from Khuza'a tribe and told the Prophet that Ka'b bin Luai and 'Amir bin Luai were at Al-Hudaibiya with milch camels and would fight against them. The Prophet (ﷺ) said he had not come to fight, but to perform Umra. He proposed a truce to Quraish: if they accepted Islam after his victory over the infidels, they could join the other Arabs who had become Muslim. If they did not accept the truce, he would fight them defending his cause until he was killed. Budail went back to Quraish and told them what the Prophet had said. They discussed it among themselves and decided to send 'Urwa bin Mas'ud to meet with the Prophet. 'Urwa met with the Prophet and asked him not to extirpate his relatives, but the Prophet said he would accept everything they demanded if it respected Allah's laws. The Prophet (ﷺ) proposed a peace treaty: Quraish would allow Muslims to visit the Kaaba next year, and in return, the Muslims would return anyone who came to them from Quraish, even if they had become Muslim. Suhail bin 'Amr agreed to this proposal, but only on condition that Abu Jandal was returned to him. The Prophet (ﷺ) accepted this condition, but later said that he would not break his promise and hand over Abu Jandal. When the peace treaty was written, the Prophet told his companions to get up and slaughter their sacrifices and shave their heads. But none of them got up, so the Prophet went out and did it himself. Seeing him do it, his companions got up and followed suit. Some believing women came to the Prophet and Allah revealed a verse about examining emigrant women. The Prophet (ﷺ) returned to Medina and Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish, came to him. He was handed over to two men who were sent by Quraish, but he killed one of them and escaped. When the other man reached Medina, he told the Prophet what had happened. The Prophet (ﷺ) said that Allah had made him fulfill his obligations by returning Abu Basir to Quraish, but had saved him from them. Abu Jandal got himself released from Quraish and joined Abu Basir. They formed a strong group and attacked Quraish caravans heading towards Sham, killing the infidels and taking their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him to send for Abu Basir and his companions, promising that whoever came to the Prophet would be secure. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent for them, and Allah revealed verses about how He had withheld their hands from each other in Mecca after making them victorious over each other."

The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered retaliation, but Anas said: 'By the One Who sent you with truth, my sister's tooth won't be broken.' The enemies accepted compensation instead of revenge.

When we approached Medina, he looked at Uhud Mountain and said it loved us. He then blessed Medina."

The Prophet (ﷺ) said that if just one person becomes Muslim because of you, it will be better than getting many red camels."

Abu Bakr said that the Prophet had said their property wouldn't be inherited and would instead be used for charity. Fatima was unhappy with this decision and stopped talking to Abu Bakr until she died six months later. She kept asking for her share, but Abu Bakr refused, saying he didn't want to leave any of the Prophet's traditions behind. Later, when Umar took over, he gave some of the property to Ali and Abbas, but kept Fadak and Khaibar under his control, saying they were meant for charity."

Malik didn't want to do this job but Umar insisted. While they were talking, Yarfa' came in and asked if Umar could see `Uthman, `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf, Az-Zubair, and Sa`d bin Abi Waqqas. Umar said yes and they came in. Later, Yarfa' came again and asked to admit `Ali and `Abbas. They also came in and greeted Umar. `Abbas asked Umar to judge between him and `Ali about the property of Bani An-Nadir, which Allah had given to His Prophet as Fai. Umar said he would talk to them about this matter. He recited some Holy Verses that explained how Allah's Apostle gave a special favor to his followers from the Fai booty. Umar then told `Ali and `Abbas that when Allah took His Prophet unto Him, Abu Bakr became his successor and managed the property in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) used to do. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him and Umar became his successor, managing the property for two years before handing it over to `Ali and `Abbas on a condition that they would manage it in the same way as Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr used to do."

I saw an enemy attacking a Muslim, so I hit him from behind with my sword. The enemy grabbed me tightly, but then he died and let go of me. After the battle, the Prophet sat down and said that anyone who killed an enemy and has proof can keep their spoils. I stood up to ask for a witness, but no one came forward. The Prophet (ﷺ) repeated his statement three times, and each time I stood up again. Finally, he asked me what had happened. I told him my story. A man then said that the spoils belonged to him, so he offered to give them to me instead. But Abu Bakr disagreed, saying the Prophet wouldn't agree to this. The Prophet (ﷺ) agreed with Abu Bakr and gave the spoils to me. I sold the armor for a garden in Bani Salima, which was my first property after becoming Muslim."

Al-Buraq, a white animal smaller than a mule but bigger than a donkey, took him on a journey with Gabriel. They went through seven heavens, meeting prophets like Adam, Jesus, and Abraham along the way. At each heaven, they were asked who they were and if Muhammad (ﷺ) had been sent for. Each time, it was said that he was welcomed and his visit was wonderful. In the seventh heaven, Muhammad (ﷺ) saw Allah's House where 70,000 angels pray every day. He also saw a special tree with four rivers at its root. Fifty prayers were ordered for him, but he went back to Moses who advised him to reduce the number of prayers because it would be too hard for his followers. So, Muhammad (ﷺ) asked Allah to reduce the number of prayers five times until it was finally reduced to five. When he came back to Moses, he said that Allah had made it five and he accepted it."

Then Allah sent a message to Moses saying Al-Khadir was indeed wiser. Moses wanted to meet Al-Khadir, so he was given a sign - a fish that would help him find his companion. When the fish disappeared, Moses went back and followed its tracks until he found Al-Khadir."

Moses said he was, but Allah scolded him for not giving credit to Him. Then He said there was someone at the sea who knew more than Moses. Moses wanted to meet this person and asked how to find him. Allah told him to take a fish in a basket and follow it. The fish would lead them to the man. They followed the fish, which swam into the sea like a tunnel. When they reached the place where the fish stopped, they met Al-Khadir. He was lying on his side with a garment covering him. Moses greeted him, and he asked how people greet in their land. Then Al-Khadir said some of Allah's knowledge that Moses didn't know, and vice versa. Moses wanted to follow Al-Khadir, but he warned him that he wouldn't be patient for things he couldn't understand. They traveled along the sea shore until a boat passed by them. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board without charging anything. On the boat, a sparrow dipped its beak into the sea, and Al-Khadir said this reduced Allah's knowledge as much as the water reduced. Then he took an adze and plucked a plank from the boat, making a hole in it. Moses thought this was wrong but didn't understand why. They left the sea and passed by a boy playing with other children. Al-Khadir took hold of the boy's head and killed him like he would pick fruit. Moses was shocked and said this was a horrible thing to do. Al-Khadir told him again that he couldn't be patient for things he didn't understand. They went on until they came to a village where people refused to give them food or shelter. But when they left, Al-Khadir touched the wall of their house, and it became stable again. Moses was confused and said this seemed unfair. Al-Khadir told him that this was the end of their time together and explained what had happened."

She said there was no water nearby, but we asked her to come with us to meet the Prophet. When she saw the Prophet, she told him about the lack of water and that she had children at home who needed it. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered her water skins to be brought and he rubbed them together so everyone could drink. We drank until our thirst was gone and filled up all our containers with water. But we didn't give any water to the camels yet. When the woman went back to her people, she told them about the Prophet's kindness. They were amazed and eventually became Muslims too."

The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Adi if he knew Al-Hira. Adi said no, but he had heard of it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said that one day, a woman from Al-Hira would travel safely to Mecca and walk around the Kaaba, only fearing Allah. Adi wondered what would happen to the robbers who were causing trouble in their tribe. The Prophet (ﷺ) then said that if Adi lived long enough, he would see people carrying handfuls of gold or silver looking for someone to give it to, but finding no one. When a person meets Allah on Judgment Day, they will not need an interpreter. Allah will ask them if they were taught by a messenger and given wealth. They will say yes, then look left and right and only see Hell. The Prophet (ﷺ) said that even giving half a date in charity can save someone from the Fire. If you don't have a date, give a kind word."

A shepherd came with his sheep to the same rock. I asked him if he belonged to someone from Medina or Mecca. He said yes, and I asked if his sheep had milk. He said they did, so I asked him to milk some for us. He gave me a container of milk and I poured it into another container that was ready for the Prophet's drink and ablution. The Prophet (ﷺ) woke up, drank the milk, and then we left after midday. Suraqa bin Malik followed us, but I thought he had discovered us.

They poured water on the milk container and gave it to the Prophet, who drank until Abu Bakr was pleased. Then they left Mecca while the people were searching for them.

He asked for permission to be buried with the Prophet and Abu Bakr, but Hafsa said no. Then she gave permission after talking to Abdullah bin Umar. When `Umar died, people wanted him to appoint a successor. He recommended six men: Ali, Uthman, Zubair, Talha, Sa'd, and Abdur-Rahman.

A small white animal was brought to the Prophet, which was smaller than a mule but bigger than a donkey. This was called Buraq. Gabriel rode on Buraq with the Prophet and they went up to the first heaven. There, they met Adam, who greeted the Prophet warmly. They then moved on to the second heaven, where they met John and Jesus, who also greeted the Prophet. They continued this way, meeting prophets like Joseph, Idris, Aaron, and Moses in each of the heavens. When they reached the seventh heaven, they saw Abraham, who was the Prophet's father. The Prophet (ﷺ) was then taken to a special tree called Sidrat-ul-Muntaha, which had huge fruits and leaves. Gabriel explained that this tree marked the boundary between the heavens and the earth. The Prophet (ﷺ) was shown three containers: one with wine, one with milk, and one with honey. He chose the milk, which represented Islam. Then, the prayers were given to the Prophet, but they were too many for his followers to bear. So, he went back to Allah and asked for a reduction in the number of prayers.

The Prophet (ﷺ) was still in Mecca. When he got permission to leave, he asked Abu Bakr to wait a little longer. Abu Bakr stayed with his two camels for four months. One day, the Prophet came to Abu Bakr's house and said it was time to go. They left their homes secretly, guided by a man from Bani Ad-Dail. When they were near Medina, Suraqa bin Ju'shum saw them but decided not to harm them after drawing lots with divining arrows. He told the Prophet about the plans of the people in Mecca and offered him food and goods, but the Prophet refused. The Prophet (ﷺ) wrote a statement of security for Suraqa and then continued on his way. When the Muslims of Medina heard that the Prophet was coming, they went to the Harra every morning to meet him. One day, they saw him emerging from the desert mirage with Abu Bakr. They welcomed him warmly and he stayed at Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights.

Abu Sufyan mentioned their idol Al-Uzza, but the Prophet's companions replied that Allah is their Helper."

Eventually, the Prophet allowed his men to respond to Abu Sufyan's claims that their gods were better than Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) told them to say 'Allah is greater' and that He is their helper."

The Prophet (ﷺ) did send `Uthman to Mecca after the Pledge of allegiance took place. When `Uthman returned, the Prophet raised his right hand and said 'This is for `Uthman.'

He died from this wound. After Islam spread, Wahshi left Mecca for Taif. When the Prophet's messengers came to Taif, Wahshi went with them to meet the Prophet. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked if it was him who killed Hamza. Wahshi said yes and hid his face. Later, when Musailamah appeared as a prophet, Wahshi wanted to kill him to make amends for killing Hamza.

But 'Amir got sick with a plague while staying at Um Sulaim's house. He said, 'Get me my horse' and died on it. Then his brother Haram went to talk to the pagans. They killed him, but not before he said, 'Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded!' The Prophet (ﷺ) was sad about this and invoked evil upon the tribes that disobeyed Allah and His Apostle for 30 days."

She said her situation was like Jacob's sons when he said only Allah can help them. The Prophet (ﷺ) left without speaking. Then Allah proved `Aisha's innocence. `Aisha thanked Allah alone."

They wanted him to agree to a peace treaty that said he could only stay there for three days. The Muslims wrote the treaty, but it said 'Muhammad (ﷺ), Apostle of Allah' had agreed to it. The people of Mecca didn't want this title, so they asked Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) to change it. He told Ali to erase it, but Ali refused. Then Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) took the paper and rewrote it himself. It said that he could bring only sheathed swords into Mecca and couldn't take anyone from there with him. When the allowed time was over, the people of Mecca asked Ali to tell Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) to leave. He left, and his daughter-in-law Fatima gave her horse to the daughter of Hamza so she could follow him. Later, when they got back to Medina, three men argued about who should take care of the girl. They were Ali, Zaid, and Ja'far. The Prophet (ﷺ) said that the aunt is like a mother, so he gave the girl to her aunt. He also told each man something special: Ali was from him and he was from Ali; Ja'far looked like him and had his character; and Zaid was their brother and freed slave. Ali asked if he could marry the daughter of Hamza, but the Prophet said no because she was the daughter of his foster brother."

When my father returned from meeting Muhammad (ﷺ), he said he had come to our tribe for sure. The Prophet (ﷺ) told us when it's time for prayer, one person should call out to others and another person with good knowledge of the Quran should lead the prayer. They chose me because I knew more Quran than anyone else. At that time, I was a young boy wearing a small shirt. A woman from our tribe said they should cover my backside while I led the prayer. So, they bought some cloth and made me a new shirt. I had never been happier with anything before."

Later, when he felt better, the Prophet gave three instructions: get rid of the non-Muslims from our land, treat foreign visitors with respect and kindness as we have done before, and... (Ibn Abbas forgot or didn't want to share the third instruction)."

In response, Allah sent a message saying that if the Prophet divorced all his wives, Allah would give him even better ones."

He asked, 'Who is the most learned person?' Moses said it was him. But Allah said, 'There's someone more knowledgeable than you.' This person was at the sea where two seas meet. Moses wanted to find this person and asked how. Allah said to put a fish in a basket and follow it. When they reached the rock, they fell asleep, and the fish got out of the basket and swam through the sea like a tunnel. The next morning, Moses was still tired, but his servant forgot about the fish. They continued their journey until they found Al-Khadir, who was covered with a garment. Moses greeted him, and Al-Khadir asked if that was how people greeted in Israel. Moses said he was Moses, and Al-Khadir asked if he was the one from the children of Israel. Moses wanted to learn from Al-Khadir, but Al-Khadir said Moses wouldn't be patient. He said they had some knowledge from Allah, but not all of it. Moses promised to be patient and follow Al-Khadir. They traveled along the sea coast until a boat passed by, and Al-Khadir got on board with Moses. When they were on the boat, Al-Khadir pulled out one of its planks, which made Moses think he was scuttling the boat to drown its people. Al-Khadir said Moses couldn't be patient. Then they got off the boat, and while walking on the shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. He killed the boy, which made Moses angry because it was an innocent life. Al-Khadir said Moses still couldn't be patient. Moses then told him not to talk to him anymore if he asked any more questions. They came across people in a town who refused to feed them or give them shelter. But when they found a wall about to fall, Al-Khadir fixed it with his own hands. Moses was still upset because these people didn't treat them well. Al-Khadir said this was the end of their journey together and explained that Moses couldn't be patient."

Moses asked for a sign so he could recognize the place, and Allah said to look for a fish that would come alive in his basket. When the fish left the basket, Moses followed it and found Al-Khadir on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. They traveled together and came across a boat. The crew recognized Al-Khadir as a pious slave of Allah and said they wouldn't take him on board unless he paid the fare. Al-Khadir scuttled the boat, but then plugged the hole with wood so it wouldn't sink. Moses was upset and asked why Al-Khadir had done this. Al-Khadir said that Moses couldn't be patient with him. They continued their journey and found a boy playing. Al-Khadir killed the boy, which made Moses very upset. He asked why Al-Khadir had done such a thing. Al-Khadir explained that he was trying to protect the boy's parents from his evil ways. They then came across a wall that was about to fall down, and Al-Khadir set it straight with just one touch of his hand. Moses was amazed and asked why Al-Khadir had done this for free. Al-Khadir said they could have taken payment if they wanted to eat from it. As they continued on their journey, a king who took over every ship that passed by came into view. Al-Khadir didn't want the boat to be taken, so he scuttled it again and plugged the hole with tar this time. Moses was upset again, but Al-Khadir explained that he had killed an innocent boy to protect his parents from his evil ways. They were then compensated by being given a girl instead."

I was innocent. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked Barira, his slave girl, if she knew anything about the situation. She said that I sometimes fell asleep and left food unattended, but that's all. The Prophet (ﷺ) then stood on the pulpit and asked for someone to help him against the man who had spread these false rumors. Sa'd bin Mu'adh was willing to kill the man, but another man from the Khazraj tribe disagreed. This led to a big argument between the two tribes. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried to calm them down, but I was so sad and upset that I didn't sleep for three days and nights. Finally, Allah revealed a verse that declared my innocence. Abu Bakr, who had been helping Mistah bin Uthatha because of his poverty, said he would no longer help him after the rumors were spread. But then Allah revealed another verse saying that those who are good and wealthy should forgive their relatives in need. Abu Bakr was so happy to be forgiven by Allah that he started giving Mistah aid again."

The Prophet (ﷺ) asked the people for their opinion on this matter. One man suggested chopping off the heads of those who made the accusation. But then someone else pointed out that if they were from a different tribe, he wouldn't want to harm them. Aisha's mother and father knew about the story but didn't feel as upset as Aisha did. They told her to be calm and not worry. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent a servant with Aisha to her parents' house. Her mother said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) already knew about the story, and so did Abu Bakr. Aisha was very sad and cried. When she returned home, the Prophet asked his maid-servant about Aisha's character. The maid said she didn't know of any fault in Aisha except that she slept during the day and let sheep enter her house to eat her dough. Some companions spoke harshly to the maid, but then they told her about the affair. She said she knew nothing against Aisha except what a goldsmith knows about pure gold. The man who was accused of being with Aisha denied it and said he had never uncovered any woman's private parts. He was later martyred in Allah's Cause. The next morning, Aisha's parents came to visit her, and the Prophet came after offering his Asr prayer. He praised and glorified Allah and told Aisha that if she had done something wrong, she should repent to Allah. An Ansari woman was sitting nearby, so the Prophet gave some advice. Aisha asked her father to answer for her, but he didn't know what to say. Then Aisha turned to her mother, but she also didn't know what to say. So Aisha testified that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad (ﷺ) is His Messenger. She said if she told the truth about not doing anything wrong, it wouldn't help because people had already spoken badly of her. And if she confessed to doing something wrong when she hadn't, they would say she was guilty. Aisha compared herself to Joseph's father, who said patience is most fitting against what they were accusing him of. At that moment, Allah revealed a message to the Prophet, and we remained silent. Then the message was over, and I saw the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing sweat from his forehead and saying, 'Have good tidings O Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.'"

        "content": "A man from the tribe of Kinda gave a speech about the Day of Resurrection. He said that smoke would cover everything and make hypocrites lose their senses, but believers would only feel like they had a cold. This scared some people, so they went to Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud for advice. He told them it's better to say 'Allah knows best' if you don't know something. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) was asked by Allah to share the Quran with others, and he said he didn't ask for anything in return. Some people from the Quraish tribe delayed accepting Islam, so the Prophet prayed for help against them. He asked Allah to send a famine like the one Joseph experienced, which happened and caused great suffering. People saw smoke between the sky and earth because of their hunger. Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and asked him to pray for his family, who were struggling. Then Ibn Mas'ud recited a verse from the Quran that talks about smoke on the Day of Judgement. The punishment was stopped, but they went back to their old ways. Allah threatened them with a great punishment, which happened on the day of the Battle of Badr. Another verse says that the Romans were defeated, but later won again."

The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, 'Islam means worshipping only Allah, praying regularly, giving charity to those who need it, and fasting during the month of Ramadan.' The man also asked about something called Ihsan. The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'Ihsan means treating Allah as if you can see Him. If you can't do that, know that He sees everything you do.' The man then asked when the Day of Judgment would come. The Prophet (ﷺ) said he didn't know but could describe some signs that will happen before it comes. These signs include a slave woman giving birth to her master and people who are poor and naked becoming leaders. Only Allah knows when the Day of Judgment will be."

The idol Wadd was worshipped by the Kalb tribe at Daumat-al-Jandal, Suwa' by the Hudhail tribe, Yaghouth by the Murad and Ghutaif tribes near Saba, Ya'uq by Hamdan, and Nasr by Himyar. These idols were named after some good people from Noah's time who died. Satan made their followers create statues at the places where these people used to sit, calling them by those names. People started worshipping these idols when the original worshippers had passed away and no one knew where they came from."

He went home and tried to find something to give, even an iron ring, but couldn't. He offered his only garment, a waist sheet, saying he would give half of it to her. The Prophet (ﷺ) said this wouldn't work because she would be naked if she wore it, or he would be naked if he wore it. The man left, but the Prophet called him back and asked how much of the Quran he knew by heart. When the man replied that he could recite several suras, the Prophet agreed to let him marry her in exchange for what he knew of the Quran."

One type was like today's marriage, where a man asks for a woman's hand and gives her a gift called Mahr. The second type was called Al-Istibda', where a husband would let his wife sleep with another man to have a child of noble breed. If she got pregnant, he could then sleep with her again. The third type was when a group of men would have sex with one woman, and if she got pregnant, they would all be called in and the child would follow whoever she chose as its father. The fourth type was prostitution, where many men would visit a woman and she would never refuse anyone. If someone got her pregnant, all the men involved would gather to see who the child's father was. When Islam came, these types of marriage were abolished except for the one we use today."

Umar replied, 'Aisha and Hafsa.' Then Umar told Ibn Abbas that he used to visit the Prophet with his Ansari friend from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid. They would take turns visiting the Prophet and sharing news about what was happening in Medina. One day, Umar's wife said that the wives of the Prophet would sometimes not talk to him for a whole day. This scared Umar and he went to Hafsa and asked her if it was true. She replied yes. Umar then warned Hafsa not to imitate Aisha's behavior, saying she was more charming than her and beloved by the Prophet. Meanwhile, there were rumors that the tribe of Ghassan was preparing to invade Medina. When Umar's Ansari friend came back from his visit to the Prophet, he told Umar that the Prophet had divorced his wives. Umar went to see the Prophet in seclusion and asked him if he had really divorced them. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied no. Umar then sat with a group of people near the pulpit but couldn't bear the situation and kept asking for permission to enter the Prophet's room. Finally, the slave gave him permission and Umar entered the room. He saw the Prophet lying on a bed made of date palm leaves and asked if he had divorced his wives again. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied no and smiled when Umar said that the men in Medina were overpowered by their women. When Umar sat down, he looked around the Prophet's house and saw only three hides. He then prayed for the Prophet to be given wealth, saying that the Persians and Romans had been made prosperous despite not worshiping Allah. The Prophet (ﷺ) sat up and said that these people had received rewards for their good deeds in this world. Umar apologized and asked for forgiveness. After twenty-nine days, the Prophet entered Aisha's room first and she chose him. He then gave his other wives an option to choose him as well."

If you see an eclipse, remember to pray to Allah. Some people asked the Prophet what he saw during the eclipse. He said he saw Paradise and Hellfire. In Paradise, he wanted to pick some grapes for his followers to eat forever.

When one year passed, she'd rub herself against an animal like a donkey or sheep, then be given dung to throw away before using perfume again."

He said that ten sheep are equal to one camel. One of our camels ran away, but a man shot it with an arrow and stopped it. The Prophet (ﷺ) said that some animals can be wild, so if they run away, we should treat them like this. I asked the Prophet about slaughtering our animals without knives. He said that if we use any tool to cut their throats and say Allah's Name, we can eat from them. But we shouldn't use our teeth or nails to slaughter them. The Prophet (ﷺ) explained that a tooth is just a bone, and a nail is like the knife used by Ethiopians."

Others said it would be safer to leave. Umar then asked for advice from another group, but they also disagreed. He finally asked for advice from older men from the tribe of Quraish. They all agreed that it was best to return home. Umar announced that he would go back to Medina and everyone should follow him. One leader, Abu 'Ubaida, questioned this decision, saying they were running away from what Allah had ordained. But Umar explained that if they had a choice between two places, one with food and one without, they would choose the place with food if Allah wanted them to eat there. He said they should follow Allah's will and return home. Just then, another leader, 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'Auf, arrived and reminded everyone of a saying from the Prophet: 'If you hear about sickness in an area, don't go there. But if sickness breaks out where you are, don't run away.' Umar thanked Allah and returned to Medina."

The Prophet (ﷺ) told him this made sense, and said he had a secret thought about him. Ibn Saiyad said it was something called Ad-Dukh, but the Prophet said that was not right. `Umar wanted to hurt Ibn Saiyad because he might be the Dajjal (a bad person), but the Prophet stopped him. Later, the Prophet and another man went back to see Ibn Saiyad in a garden. The Prophet (ﷺ) hid behind some palm trees so he could listen without being seen. He heard Ibn Saiyad talking to himself, and his mother saw the Prophet and told Ibn Saiyad. The Prophet (ﷺ) wanted to hear more from Ibn Saiyad, but his mother's warning stopped him."

In this group, there were Muslims, people who didn't believe in Allah, and Jews. When the donkey kicked up dust, Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and said, 'Don't make us dusty.' The Prophet (ﷺ) greeted them, got off the donkey, and invited them to become Muslim. He recited some of the Quran to them. Abdullah bin Ubai said, 'What you're saying is good if it's true. But please don't talk about this in our gatherings.' Abdullah bin Rawaha said, 'Yes, invite us when we're together.' The group started arguing and were almost fighting. The Prophet (ﷺ) stayed quiet until they calmed down. Then he got back on the donkey and went to visit Sa'd. When he arrived, he asked if Sa'd had heard what Abdullah bin Ubai had said. Sa'd said, 'Let my father be sacrificed for you! Forgive him.' He explained that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was sent at a time when people were planning to make Abdullah bin Ubai their leader. When Allah prevented this from happening, Abdullah bin Ubai felt choked and behaved badly. The Prophet (ﷺ) forgave him. It was the custom of the Prophet and his companions to forgive people who didn't believe in Allah, as Allah ordered them to be patient with those who annoyed them. After the battle of Badr, when Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought against the pagans and killed some of their leaders, Abdullah bin Ubai and others said, 'This matter has triumphed. So give the Prophet your pledge of allegiance.' They became Muslims."

Then Allah gives them a soul. A person may do good deeds until it's almost too late, but then they start doing bad things instead. Or they might do bad things most of the time, but then they change and do good deeds just before they die.'"

The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered hot iron pieces to be made and used to brand their eyes. He also cut off their hands and feet without treating the wounds. Finally, they were left in a place called Al-Harra without water until they died."

He then asked Abu Qilaba what he thought. Abu Qilaba said, 'If fifty army chiefs testified that a man committed adultery without seeing him, would you stone him?' Umar said no. Abu Qilaba continued, 'And if they testified that someone stole in Hums, would you cut off his hand even though they didn't see it?' Again, Umar said no. Abu Qilaba then explained what the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) did in three situations: when someone killed unjustly, a married person committed adultery, or someone fought against Allah and His Messenger. The people mentioned that Anas bin Malik narrated that the Prophet cut off thieves' hands and branded their eyes. Abu Qilaba said he would explain this narration. He told them about eight people from the tribe of 'Ukl who became sick in Medina and drank camel's milk and urine as medicine, but then killed the Messenger's shepherd and took his camels. The Prophet (ﷺ) ordered to cut off their hands and feet, brand their eyes with hot iron, and leave them in the sun until they died. Abu Qilaba said this was a tradition set by Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). He also told about a group of Ansari people who found one of their companions killed and suspected the Jews. The Prophet (ﷺ) sent for the Jews and asked if they had killed him, but they denied it. He then offered to let 50 Jews take an oath that they didn't kill him, but the Ansars refused. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself paid the blood-money instead. Abu Qilaba also mentioned a case where the tribe of Hudhail repudiated one of their men and later accused a Yemenite family of killing him. They asked Umar to let 50 people from Hudhail swear that they hadn't repudiated him, but one person paid money instead of taking the oath. Later, Abdul Malik bin Marwan sentenced someone to death in Qisas based on Al-Qasama but later regretted it and ordered the names of those who took the oath to be erased."

She then took him to her cousin Waraqa bin Naufal, who was a Christian and could read Arabic. Waraqa recognized Gabriel as the same angel who helped Moses. He said Muhammad 's (ﷺ) people would reject him, but if he lived longer, he would support Muhammad (ﷺ) strongly. Unfortunately, Waraqa died soon after. The revelation stopped for a while, and Muhammad (ﷺ) became sad. He wanted to throw himself from mountains, but Gabriel kept appearing to him and saying, 'You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)'.

The Prophet 's (ﷺ) companions told them to jump into a river that flowed through the city, and when they did, their ugliness disappeared. The Prophet (ﷺ) realized this was Paradise and his own place in it. He asked his companions what all these things meant. They explained each scene: one man represented someone who studied the Quran but didn't act on it; another man represented someone who told many lies; naked men and women were adulterers; a man eating stones was an usurer; and a bad-looking man near a fire was the gatekeeper of Hell. The tall man in the garden was Abraham, and the children around him were those who died as Muslims. The Prophet 's (ﷺ) companions also explained that the half handsome and half ugly men had mixed good and bad actions but were forgiven by Allah."

From then on, when Umar talked to the Prophet, he spoke quietly and sometimes even whispered so softly that the Prophet couldn't hear him."

Even if the horses break their ropes and run around, it will still count as good deeds. If the horses drink water from a river without being asked to, it will also be counted as good deeds. Horses kept for a person's livelihood but with the intention of using them for Allah's Cause are like a shelter from poverty. But if someone keeps horses just to show off or feel proud, they become a source of sin. When asked about donkeys, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said that anyone who does good things, no matter how small, will see it in the next life, and so will those who do bad things."

In Hell, there are hooks like thorns that will punish people according to their deeds. Some people will stay in Hell because of their bad actions, some will be torn by the hooks, and some will be punished but then relieved.

Some believers will cross quickly, while others will get scratched or fall into Hell. The last person will be dragged across. On that day, the believers will ask Allah to save their brothers who used to pray and fast with them.

Gabriel replied that he was Muhammad (ﷺ), and that he had been sent. When they reached the seventh heaven, Moses asked Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) how many prayers his followers were required to perform. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied that they were 50 in a day and night. Moses said this was too much for them, so the Prophet went back to Allah to ask him to reduce it.

So, he took Hisham to the Prophet and said, 'I heard this man reciting Surat-al-Furqan differently.' The Prophet (ﷺ) told Umar to let Hisham go and recite again. When Hisham did, the Prophet said it was revealed like that. Then the Prophet asked Umar to recite his way. The Prophet (ﷺ) said it was also correct. He explained that the Quran can be recited in seven different ways."

The men were surprised that the Prophet broke his own oath by giving them better mounts. He explained to them that if something better comes along, it's okay to do that and make up for the broken oath."
